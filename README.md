Simple BootLoader for learning and fun.

This project is just a PoC of simple bootloader development with dummy kernel.


## Plan Of Record

- A program (bootloader) that can be loaded by BIOS

- A bootloader that can do some stuff

- A dummy kernel written in C programing language, simply prints words on the screen.
